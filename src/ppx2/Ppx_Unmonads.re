Things I would like:

// maybe this is overkill? also probably harder to parse
switch%opt (somethingOptional) {
| theContents =>
};

// so each non-wildcard branch is wrapped in `Some`. Is this too weird?
switch%orNone (x) {
  | each => case
  | doesntNeed => toBe
  | aSome => atTheEnd
  | _ => None
}

Alsoooo I really want to be able to provide
hover-for-explanation for %ppx extension points.
How could I do that in a general way?

Done!!! As long as the ppx drops a `[@ocaml.explanation "some text"]`
somewhere, the `loc` of attribute's `loc(string)` bit will be used to
show the hover text that is the context of the attribute.

[@ocaml.explanation {|

```
let%opt name = value;
otherStuff
```
is transformed into
```
switch (value) {
  | None => None
  | Some(name) =>
    otherStuff
}
```
This means that `otherStuff` needs to end with an optional.

If you want `otherStuff` to be automatically wrapped in `Some()`,
then use `let%opt_wrap`.
Alternatively, if you are just performing a side effect, and want
the result of the whole thing to be unit, use `let%consume`.
